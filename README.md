###### Click on the image above to watch the **Quick-Start Guide**.

### Introduction:
**Automeet** is all about automating the process of logging **in** and **out** when attending a Meeting on Google Meet platform with a single run.

**Code by:** Pavana Narayana Bhat

### PreRequisites:
- **Windows** Operating system.
- Brave / Chrome (v**90.0** or **above**).
- A Google **Account**.
- **Stable Internet** connection.
- It is RECOMMENDED to **TURN ON** **LESS SECURE APP ACCESS** in **Security Settings** which comes under **Google Settings** in order to avoid being detected and blocked on trying more than **thrice**(3 times).

### Usage:
- Once the **PreRequisites** is satisfied, **Download** the executable from the *[releases section](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/releases/latest)*.
- Run the **Automeet.exe**.
- Enter your **Google Account Login Credentials** that you use to join your meet meetings. **Automeet** takes care of the rest.

### Things to keep in mind:
- Please make sure that the **Google Meet meetings are scheduled on your Google Calendar** and the timings **doesnot** overlap with each other(like 2 meetings at the same time or whatever).
- Do note that the **Password** that you enter will show you nothing.
- **If you ever get _"Couldn't sign in you in, Your browser may be insecure and blah blah blah"_, Try clearing the _temp_ directory by pressing "WINDOWS_BUTTON + R" and type "%temp%" and select all by pressing "Ctrl + A", click "SHIFT+DELETE", and "OK"**.
- Google **blocks** login if you try to login **3**+ times in a day for **24**+ hours.(_You know, Just Google things! If anything goes against it, block!_).
- Blame/Curse Google every single day, every single minute.

### Found any bugs?
Incase if you find any bugs, please raise an *[Issue Ticket](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/issues/new/choose)* under the *[Issues Tab](https://github.com/pixincreate/Automeet/issues)* in this Repository. Will look into it, then solve the issue if it exist ASAP.

**Note:**  A **Warning** exists the .py file. To learn more about the warning, click *[**here**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63958561/how-to-merge-chromedriver-exe-with-a-python-script-that-runs-on-selenium-webdriv/63959432#63959432)*.

### FAQ:
*Q*: **Why _Automeet_ is SLOW at Start up**?  
*A*: It is a standalone executable file that contains all the required files to run the **Automeet**. As the executable creates a temporary folder to extract the files that are requierd by the **Automeet** to run during the Start up, it takes around `2 - 5` seconds at Max!

*Q*: **How EXECUTABLES are made**?  
*A*: `.exe` has been created using *[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)*.
  
*Q*: **How login process works**?**any references**?  
*A*: Login works by redirecting Google Login to stackoverflow page using "DN" user-agent which is outdated and I believe that Google doesn't block that.  Visit below given links for reference:

### Feature updates(will be added - If Online meetings continues to be conducted everywhere):
- Auto attendance (for students) that puts Present Sir / Mam on behalf of you.
- Make the UI interactable by replacing CLI with GUI.
- Add option for placing Meet links along with the Calendar scheduled links in meet homepage with the help of GUI.(Major update)
