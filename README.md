### FAQ:
*Q*: **Why _Automeet_ is SLOW at Start up**?  
*A*: It is a standalone executable file that contains all the required files to run the **Automeet**. As the executable creates a temporary folder to extract the files that are requierd by the **Automeet** to run during the Start up, it takes around `2 - 5` seconds at Max!

*Q*: **How EXECUTABLES are made**?  
*A*: `.exe` has been created using *[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)*.

### Feature updates(will be added - If Online meetings continues to be conducted everywhere):
- Auto attendance (for students) that puts Present Sir / Mam on behalf of you.
- Make the UI interactable by replacing CLI with GUI.
- Add option for placing Meet links along with the Calendar scheduled links in meet homepage with the help of GUI.(Major update)
